                        <p>After that terrible night fifteen years ago, Ishaan had vowed to never return to his hometown. But when has destiny been so kind to our plans!
                            When Ishaan thought life was at its best, the world was hit by a deadly pandemic. India went under complete lockdown, and he unwillingly ended up at a house he once called home.
                            He isn’t prepared to stay in Bhopal for an entire month. That too with the father he doesn’t relate to anymore, an elder brother who broke his trust, and a mother who didn’t stand for him all those years ago. He is figuring out what to do, when he fell in love with The Girl Next Door
                            Ruhi is a well-known choreographer and the chief minister’s daughter, back home for the lockdown. As much as people were staying away from each other, Ishaan’s and Ruhi’s hearts were coming closer to beat as one - in the 90’s way. Their love was breathing the 1990s in 2020.
                            Will this lockdown teach Ishaan to love once again? Will he learn the true meaning of forgiveness? Will his love story be eclipsed by the life-threatening pandemic?
                            This extraordinary story of love will melt your heart and make you believe in the power of true love.</p>
